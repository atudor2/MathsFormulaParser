Brief description of the grammar for Formulae:

Has the basic mathematical operations:

+ Add
- Subtract
* Multiply
/ Int Div
% Mod
** Power

& Bitwise AND
| Bitwise OR
^ Bitwise XOR
~ Bitwise NOT

( Start Sub Expression
) End Sub expression

>> Right bit shift
<< Left bit shift

Constants:
=====================
PI = PI
E = Eulers number


Variables:
=====================
Currently there are 4 variables:

A
B
C
D

Each representing a big endian byte of an OBD response. It is possible to access the bits directly via the subscript:

A[x]

Variables can ONLY be letters

Implementation:
=====================
Currently implemented as a Reverse Polish Notation
